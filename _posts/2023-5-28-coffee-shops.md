My feelings about some of the coffee shops around Toronto.

## Third Wave Coffee Inc.

* Rating: 4/5
* Drink ordered: cortada

The coffee was good. The interior was kind of clean industrial. The music could have been better.

## Neo Coffee Bar

* Drink ordered: espresso

They gave me fizzy water with the espresso which was fun. I spilt half of the espresso though :)

## Everyday Gourmet

The coffee was very bitter and there weren't many places to sit (it's in the St. Lawrence Market though, so probably not their fault).

## The Black Canary Espresso Bar

The coffee was good! I also liked the interior and the vibes. My partner also liked the London Fog they served.
